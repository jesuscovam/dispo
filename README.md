These 3 files (init, ss, crop)
will give us precious time back to us from
have to these things manually:

init:
will create the directories needed

ss:
is a function to be executed from the python cli
to easily save the screenshots from the dispo into 
a directory

crop:
will crop all the png's file from the imgs directory
to the actual size Pedro will need to read.
